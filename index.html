                        <div>
                            <small>FLAIM Trainer is a firefighter training simulator that utilizes a virtual reality
                                environment, haptic feedback, and custom equipment to provide a low-cost solution for
                                training in hazardous and emergency situations.</small>

                        <div>
                            <small>It is the result of over 10 years of research at Deakin University, Australia. The
                                models in FLAIM are intended to mimic a fire envionment as realistically as possible,
                                from the way that it reacts to the user to how it spreads and ignites on different
                                materials.</small>

                <div>
                    <small>FLAIM is being developed as a low*-cost alternative and supplement to live fire training. The
                        best suited applications are for scenarios that are too dangerous or expensive (or both) to
                        constantly enact in real life.</small>

            <section>Why is it unique and a good use of VR?
                <small class="fragment">Dedicated live fire training grounds cost millions of dollars. For every one
                    firefighter, one hour is training is estimated to cost between $1000-$5000.</small>
                <small class="fragment">Resulting in firefighters getting less than one day of live training per
                    year.</small>
                <p class="fragment">In comparison, one hour of FLAIM Trainer training costs $16 if used consistently
                    over a 5 year period.</p>
            </section>
            <section>Weaknesses
                <div>
                    <small>As of 2018, the price is $30,000.</small>
                    <p class="fragment">6.5/10 for simulation sickness - but for the right reasons. It's designed to be
                        somewhat nauseating in order to simulate a fire scenario.</p>
                    <h3 class="fragment">Nothing beats a real fire.</h3>

                <p>The Flyability drone is a Swiss made drone made for search and rescue missions and is equipped with
                    thermal cameras.</p>
                <p>Darley Systems, who sells FLAIM in the United States, also utilizes drones equipped with cameras and
                    hoses to assist firefighters.</p>

                        <li>AR drone assistance in fire</li>
                        <li>More development in the area of haptic feedback for a more realistic experience</li>
                        <li>Training for other departments concerned with public safety (natural disasters)</li>

            <section> Conclusion
                <div>
                    VR in application to provide training for emergency situations has a lot of potential. It has a while to go before it's comparable with real scenarios, but FLAIM is already being used for training.
